<h1>Parisian-Style Steak Frites</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ol>
  <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
  <li>2 hanger steaks</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons minced shallot</li>
  <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
  <li>¼ cup beef broth</li>
  <li>2 anchovy fillets, chopped, or more to taste</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh chervil</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme</li>
</ol>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
Heat vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cook steaks to desired doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a plate to rest.
<h4>Step 2</h4>
Place shallots in the skillet and cook until beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. Pour wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Add broth and anchovy; cook until thickened to sauce consistency, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat; whisk butter in gradually. Stir parsley, chervil, and thyme into the sauce. Purée sauce in the skillet with an immersion blender until smooth.
<h4>Step 3</h4>
Cut steaks into thin slices across the grain; spoon sauce over slices.

<h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
Chicken broth may be substituted for the beef broth, if desired. I prefer homemade broth for this recipe.

Anchovy paste can be substituted for anchovy fillets, if desired.
